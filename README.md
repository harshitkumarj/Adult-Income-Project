# Adult-Income-Project

## Goals
**Can the data help to predict whether the income is '>50k'?** 
The data contains anonymous information such as age, occupation, education, working class, etc. The goal is to train a binary classifier to predict the income which has two possible values ‘>50K’ and ‘<50K’. There are 48842 instances and 14 attributes in the dataset. The data contains a good blend of categorical, numerical and missing values.

Our goal is to eventually provide these insights to correctly predict the Income based on these attributes.
